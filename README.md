## Setup

This Django project is currently setup using a normal virtualenv running python 3.13. Dependencies are managed via poetry, but I would like to move to uv.

Deployment is handled automatically via Github Actions to a server running dokku

### Development setup

#### Django

I have added a [justfile](https://just.systems/man/en/) to make it easier to get started from a development standpoint.

To get started for the first time (follow the prompts):

```sh
just init
just manage createsuperuser
just dev
```

Then coming back again it's just

```sh
just dev
```

There is also `just manage` as simple wrapper for running `manage.py` commands

#### Remix

The Remix app is installed as follows:

```sh
npm dev
```

It does require the following `.env` file:

```
AIRTABLE_PAT=<obtained from django>
API_URL=http://localhost:8001/api
```

To get the token visit [here](http://127.0.0.1:8001/admin/authtoken/tokenproxy/) and add a new token, then copy the key into the `.env` file
